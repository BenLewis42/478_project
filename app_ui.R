                 p("It's indisputable that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a heterogenous
                   effect across various demographic lines. Analysis of US vaccine distribution
                   reveals that poorer states seem to have lower vaccination rates. Another reason
                   why the Southern United States portrays less vaccination rates is because of the
                   lifestyle and history behind the area. Due to being a historically racist area, 
                   the South has always had problems when dealing with healthcare providers and medical
                   systems. This has caused the rollout of vaccines/boosters to become slower because it
                   is harder to convince people in those areas to get it. When comparing 
                   case rates between countries, the line is not so clear, emphasizing the wide range 
                   of potentially important variables. Just by looking at GDP, we can tell that it is not
                   the best factor to try and make comparisons because even countries with high GDPs have
                   a lot of cases and deaths. This can be attributed to the fact that these countries have
                   a larger population, so more people are susceptible to COVID-19. Interestingly, gender
                   analysis shows that overall, men are more likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19, and more
                   likely to pass away from it. There can be a myriad of reasons for this, but we believe that
                   it comes down to lifestyle and job types. For example, there are currently more men working
                   jobs in construction, transportation, and factories. These are the occupations which have the
                   higher rates for COVID-19 exposure and even deaths. In conclusion, the effects of COVID-19 seem
                   to be mediated by both gender and economic standing, but these variables are certainly not enough
                   to fully explain the virus' unequal fallout."),
