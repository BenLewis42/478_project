## **Project Description**

**What is the purpose of your research project?**

Our research project's purpose is to explore patterns in COVID-19 vaccination rates in the United States related to other factors such as age, gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, etc.

**What other research has been done in this area? Make sure to include 3+ links to related works, as well as a summary of what that work has discovered.**

1. https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/72/4/703/5860249?login=false 
This journal found that African American, LatinX, and Native American communities have been hit the hardest by Covid-19, comprising a large number of hospitalizations and deaths despite being a smaller part of the whole population. 

2. https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgwh.2021.761511/full
This research article stated that men and women have a similar rate of COVID cases. However, men are three times likely to admit into intensive care, and have a 40% higher chance of COVID-related death compared to women. Thus, the article wanted to determine if “women and men were equally recruited and represented in each vaccine's research, the outcomes of studies were presented or analysed by sex and/or gender, and there is evidence of sex and/or gender differences in outcomes” (Harris et al.). The researchers found that there was “a lack of sex/gender-specific evidence across study types of the COVID-19 vaccine experimental research studies as well as observational reporting” (Harris et al.).

This study was done to show that racial discrimination is a predictor of vaccine hesitancy.

**What is the dataset you'll be working with?  Please include background on who collected the data, where you accessed it, and any additional information we should know about how this data came to be. You must find at least two data sources at this stage.**

CDC dataset: https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccinations-in-the-United-States-County/8xkx-amqh/data

This dataset was collected and published by the CDC. It is accessible through the CDC website. It was created on May 2021 and is still being updated. This data set shows Covid-19 vaccinations county-by-county in the USA. 

Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/usa-covid19-vaccinations

This dataset was collected by ourworldindata and Edouard Mathieu. It is accessible on Kaggle. It shows state by state data on COVID-19 vaccinations in the USA. 

**Who is your target audience?  Depending on the domain of your data, there may be a variety of audiences interested in using the dataset. You should hone in on one of these audiences.**

Our target audience is policymakers as they would be able to use the data we find to help inform their decisions on where to focus their vaccination efforts in the future. 

**What should your audience learn from your resource? Please consider specific questions that your project can answer using the data you have identified (that are related to the overarching purpose)**

1. What are some different predictors of lower or higher vaccination rates?

2. Which predictors have a positive or negative effect on vaccination rates?

3. How have the vaccinate rates changed over time in relation to the different predictors?

## **Technical Description**
**What will be the format of your final product (Shiny app, HTML page, compiled .Rmd file, etc)?**

Shiny App

**Do you anticipate any specific data collection / data management challenges?**

1. CDC database is huge and requires filtering / cleaning in order for us to use it properly

2. May be hard to find data aggregated by sex

**What new technical skills will need to learn in order to complete your project?**

We will need to review how to make widgets or more complex visualizations.

**What major challenges do you anticipate?**

We anticipate that we will face the most challenges in cleaning the data and creating visualizations.
